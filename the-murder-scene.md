Holmes is found sitting at his suite's desk, having written a note in his final moments.
The room contains some items of interest:

- A complicated wooden puzzlebox on his desk. The puzzlebox is approximately 20cm to a side, covered in intricate fractal markings and number systems. It has unfolded to reveal complicated clockwork internals and what seems to be an aerosol spray whose reservoir is now empty.
- A locked rotary safe with a dial that goes from 0 to 1000. Watson does not know the combination but knows that it requires a sequence of four dial settings.
- Several framed photos of famous cases that Holmes solved.
- A scrap of a shirt that belongs to Magnum, caught near the suites window.
