Played by Alison Carey

Question: "Miss Fisher, I've travelled extensively across the world and I believe that the marks Dr Watson has described on Sherlock's skin resemble those which appear as result of a venom strike by the incredibly deadly Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake. This snake is native to your Australia, are you familiar with it and do you believe it's possible a poison might be manufactured from the snake's venom?"

Answer: "Why Miss Holt, I am aware of how deadly the Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake is, it's neurotoxin has been used by a few murderers that I am aware of. I believe it would be possible to manufacture a poison gas from it's venom and conceal a delivery mechanism in a Puzzlebox like the one Miss Dinkley gave to Mr Holmes."

Insight: You heard a few rumours going around and did a little investigating yourself into the truth of them. Velma's gang Mystery Inc is officially broke, disbanding and going out of business.
