Question: "Miss Fisher, we've had a chance to play a few games of cards so far on our journey. I must say, I detect a keen analytical mind possessing exceptional mathematical skills. Whereabouts did you study or was this something you learnt from your family?"

Answer: "Why thank you Miss Marple for such a lovely compliment, I studied in England actually, at Oxford, but I guess there has always been a strong aptitude for maths in my family. I wouldn't say I am exceptional though, you are too kind"
