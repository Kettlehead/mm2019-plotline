**Question:** Tommy Magnum, whilst searching your cabin I found safe cracking tools... Now in my book that means one of two things: 1) You're planning a heist or 2) You're just no good at remembering your own darn combination. Care to explain which it is?

Answer: "OK, I'm gonna come clean! You gotta believe me though that I nothing to do what happened to Sherlock! Sherlock Holmes had gotten himself mixed up in some business between the United States and the United Kingdom's governments. My client, a US Senator, hired me to get some sensitive documents out of Holmes' hands and back where they belong."

**Insight:** -> Magnum / Client 1 of 5
