Played by Ian Barker

**Question:** Tommy Magnum, whilst searching your cabin I found safe cracking tools... Now in my book that means one of two things: 1) You're planning a heist or 2) You're just no good at remembering your own darn combination. Care to explain which it is?

Answer: "OK, I'm gonna come clean! You gotta believe me though that I nothing to do what happened to Sherlock! Sherlock Holmes had gotten himself mixed up in some business between the United States and the United Kingdom's governments. My client, a US Senator, hired me to get some sensitive documents out of Holmes' hands and back where they belong."

**Insight:** -> You were approached by the US Senator Barbara Nixon after you received an invite aboard the Orient Express, but you've had bad dealings with them in the past, pretty crooked as far as you know even if they do keep it pretty quiet, so you didn't even find out what they wanted.
