Question: "Mr Magnum, Searching your cabin I found a case of extremely poisonous Hawaiian Flowers. Why did you bring such a deadly plant aboard?"
Answer: "I appreciate that it doesn't look good for me here as it was Sherlock Holmes himself that asked me to bring these plants for a study he was about to start on."

Insight: Knows that this particular plant's poisons interacts with its victims blood post-mortom and causes a green tinge to the victims lips post mortem. Dr Watson should be able to confirm if this was the case.
