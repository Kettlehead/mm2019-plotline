Question: "Velma, do you know whereabouts the puzzle box in the grand suite come from?"

Answer: "I intercepted it being smuggled across Europe by known associates of Moriarty. The smugglers made a number of errors and since it seemed important to them I made sure I intercepted it. I was unable to solve it and I brought it to Holmes attention after dinner."

Insight: You know that the puzzle box is mainly made from Eucalyptus wood and a number of other trees native to Australia.
