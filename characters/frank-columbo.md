Question: "Now I'm sorry Miss Dinkley but just one more thing: when the train came to a stop at a crossing, you were heard arguing with Holmes in the grand suite by myself and others in the cabin car. We could only catch a few words but it sounded very angry. What was the matter?"

Answer: "Lieutenant, I'm sorry to say that the argument was my fault and I'm real sorry that myself and Sherlock's last words were so difficult. For months now I've been hearing whispers and seeing hints that the criminal organisation that Professor Moriaty once ran has sprung back into life! Gosh! The evidence is indisputable that Sherlock's most dangerous foe Moriaty is back! I don't believe he died when he and Sherlock fought all those years ago! I laid all my findings in front of Sherlock but he infuriatingly claimed I'd missed parts of the puzzle but he wouldn't clue me in. I felt this situation was too serious for his games and I lost my temper saying so."

Insight: During dinner at 6pm and at the start of drinks around 8pm, you were certain that Magnum was keeping a careful watch on everyone's movements. Call it a hunch but it felt like he was casing a place before a heist.
