**Maddie Hayes**

Owner of Blue Moon Investigations in Los Angeles who works with David Addison.

Played by Shelagh Barker

Question: "Velma, I was speaking to Sherlock yesterday and he told me that you had been spending more time working with his contacts and network of spies than with Mystery Inc these days. He said that you had even travelled to Australia as a result but he didn't tell me why. Perhaps you could elaborate for us?"

Answer: "I travelled to Australia hoping to track down some of the missing members of Professor Moriarty's criminal organisation. The professor had spent a number of years there whilst on the run a long time ago and whilst his organisation had always extended it's tendrils across the globe, it seemed to me that he lay down roots for a while in Australia. There was some evidence of his having had started a family but nothing concrete so I can offer no details."

Insight: Shortly before you recieved your invite for this party, yourself and David were on a stake out. You were listening in on a gang and at the time it seemd quite strange that a couple of the gang members were talking about "Moriarty's Daughter", when you confronted them later during an interrogation they kept their mouths shut.
