A talented con artist who now works alongside Laura Holt in her detective agency.

Played by Royston Carey

Question: "It seems to me Mr Magnum that you are linked to the scene of the crime. What explanation do you offer for the presence of your shirt fabric?"
Answer: "I got no idea buddy, your guess is as good as mine. I do remember catching a shirt on this rickety old contraption, maybe the scrap got blown along into the grand suite."

Insight: The intelligence community has been on the hunt for a series of documents revealing corruption in Washington State, you suspect that Holmes might have had a crack at tracking them down but never got a chance to talk to him & find out.
