Question: "Magnum, at around 9pm, while most of us were in the lounge, I was coming back from my cabin and spotted you sneaking in from the outside of the train. I hid and I don't think you saw me but you were carrying a bag which I believe you stashed in your room and then joined us in the lounge. What were you up to?"

Answer: "Now listen kiddo, I know that looked suspicious and this is kinda embarrassing but... TALL STORY"
