Question: "Magnum, at around 9pm, while most of us were in the lounge, I was coming back from my cabin and spotted you sneaking in from the outside of the train. I hid and I don't think you saw me but you were carrying a bag which I believe you stashed in your room and then joined us in the lounge wearing a different shirt. What were you up to?"

Answer: "Now listen kiddo, I know that looked suspicious and this is kinda embarrassing but a lady friend of mine asked me to pick up some particular garments from some famous place in Paris. I had everything stacked precariously in my cabin, the window open and when I went to change my shirt earlier, if her precious new clothes didn't fall out of my luggage and get whisked out the window! Luckily they caught on the outside of the train, so I snuck outside, grabbed them and made it back to my room before anyone noticed or I thought I did!"
