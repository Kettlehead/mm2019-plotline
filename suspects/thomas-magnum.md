**Thomas Magnum**
An ex-military private investigator living on Oahu, Hawaii.

Weapon: Poisonous plants from Hawaii.
Evidence: Magnum was seen sneaking away from the murder scene.
Evidence: Scrap of torn fabric from one of his shirts found in the grand suite.
Evidence: Safe cracking tools were found in Magnum's cabin.
Motive: Magnum was hired by his US Senator Barbara Nixon to get the documents that Holmes had got.

- After being invited aboard the Orient Express by Holmes, Magnum was approached by a representative of the US Senator Barbara Nixon of Washington State. They informed you of a serious situation brewing in Europe that threatened American interests. Sherlock Holmes acting for the British government had claimed official US documents as their own and would be making a handoff to unknown agents in Istanbul. Your visit to Europe for Christmas was the perfect cover and opportunity to get those documents back.

Opening Statement: "I might not have known Mr Holmes as well as a lot of you, but I respected him as a detective and gentlemen. I'm no murderer and I'll help you all figure out who did this!"

**Dramatic Revelations**
- "I didn't know Senator Nixon was corrupt! I was believed I was working for the sake of the United States national security"
