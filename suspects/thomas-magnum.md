After being invited aboard the Orient Express by Holmes, Magnum was approached by a representative of the US Senator Barbara Nixon of Washington State. They informed you of a serious situation brewing in Europe that threatened American interests. Sherlock Holmes acting for the British government had claimed official US documents as their own and would be making a handoff to unknown agents in Istanbul.
