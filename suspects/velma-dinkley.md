**Velma Dinkley**
Sherlock Holme's Protege and one of the members of Mystery Inc, a group who specialise in investigating supernatural shenanigans.

Weapon: Velma gave Holmes the Puzzlebox which killed him.
Evidence: She and Holmes were heard arguing angrily.
Motive: Mystery Inc is bust and she is currently the main benefactor of Holmes' estate.

Velma has long been Holmes' protege, possessing a keen mind and exceptional detective skill.
Velma has visited Australia on the track of Moriaty's criminal organization.
Back in Europe she found the puzzle box being smuggled by old associates of the professor.

Opening Statement:
"I don't know why my mentor Sherlock Holmes has labelled me a suspect in this investigation but he must have had a reason so I will see it through. Before this terrible event, Holmes and I had become aware of agents, influence and money once associated with Professor Moriarty moving across the world. I warned Holmes that his old adversary who we believed long dead may have returned. I believe this is his attack!"

**Dramatic Revelations**

- "I believe Phryne Fisher is the daughter of Professor Moriarty!"
