**Phryne Fisher**
Phryne is a wealthy aristocrat and private detective who lives in St Kilda, Melbourne

Phryne Fisher journeyed to Europe with the aim of avenging her father Professor Moriarty and assuming control of his criminal empire.

She let clues about the puzzle box fall into Velma's hands, let her capture it, knowing that only Holmes would be able to solve it. The Puzzlebox released a poison gas.

Weapon: The poison used in the Puzzlebox is derived from the deadly venom of Yellow Bellied SeaSnake, native to Australia.
Evidence: The puzzlebox required great mathematical skill to construct, skill she possesses.
Motive: She is the daughter of James Moriarty. She is avenging his death.

Opening Statement: "I have always been a keen admirer of Sherlock Holmes and the work he has done. He was THE great detective, whose like we shall never see again. I will do everything in my power to assist this investigation and bring his murderer to justice!"

Closing Statement:

"So the great detectives final act was to help solve his own murder, a fitting end for a man my father James Moriarty considered nearly his intellectual equal. I left Australia to come and reclaim his criminal empire but first I knew I had best take revenge on the man who killed him. I let the puzzlebox fall into Velma's hands deliberately, knowing only the great Sherlock Holmes would be able to solve it. The poison gas would be instant I thought and Velma would be blamed, removing another opponent from the chessboard. There you have it, I'll not spend long in jail mark my words and the name Moriarty will be feared once more now that my only threat is dead!"
