# The Holmes Express: Outline
Sherlock Holmes has gathered the worlds finest detectives together to celebrate Christmas aboard the Orient Express.

Whilst traveling across Europe, the train becomes stuck in on the outskirts of Austria and cut off from the rest of the world as a result of a terrible snowstorm.

Sherlock Holmes is murdered and the game is afoot! He manages to write a final note that gives his list of suspects. The suspects are: Phryne Fisher, Thomas Magnum and Velma Dinkley.

Dr Watson will lead the investigation by laying out the facts, each of the suspects will give an opening statement and then Watson prompts each investigator to ask a question. After the suspects respond to all questions, then Watson will open up to cross-examination and investigators who have insights into evidence can ask further questions.

Once enough evidence has been gathered and the party is happy to decide, the suspects will have closing statements and then Watson reveals himself to have been Holmes in disguise all along.
