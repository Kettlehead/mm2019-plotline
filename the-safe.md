The safe contains:

- Phryne Fisher's genealogy. Holmes had proved that she is the daughter of Professor Moriarty.
- Sensitive documents concerning Magnum's client Senator Barbara Nixon. She is as corrupt as they come and involved in criminal enterprises across the world.
- Holmes' will, which names Velma Dinkley as his main beneficiary.
